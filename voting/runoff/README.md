# Runoff

lurality elections, which follow a very simple algorithm for determining the winner of an election: every voter gets one vote, and the candidate with the most votes wins.

But the plurality vote does have some disadvantages. What happens, for instance, in an election with three candidates, and the ballots below are cast?

plurality vote would here declare a tie between Alice and Bob, since each has two votes. But is that the right outcome?

Thereâ€™s another kind of voting system known as a ranked-choice voting system. In a ranked-choice system, voters can vote for more than one candidate. Instead of just voting for their top choice, they can rank the candidates in order of preference. The resulting ballots might therefore look like the below.

```
./runoff Alice Bob Charlie
Number of voters: 5
Rank 1: Alice
Rank 2: Bob
Rank 3: Charlie

Rank 1: Alice
Rank 2: Charlie
Rank 3: Bob

Rank 1: Bob
Rank 2: Charlie
Rank 3: Alice

Rank 1: Bob
Rank 2: Alice
Rank 3: Charlie

Rank 1: Charlie
Rank 2: Alice
Rank 3: Bob

Alice
